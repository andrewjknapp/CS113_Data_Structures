# Lab 2
## Power of Two

- #### Goal
  - Write a method that determines if a given number is a power of two
- #### Implementation
  - My solution uses the fact that a power of two, when expressed in binary, starts with a 1 and is followed by all 0's. 
  - First convert num to binary
  - If all digits are zero after the first position then the num is a power of two
- How To Run
  - Run PowerCheckTest.java
- #### Method Signature
  - public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int num)
