The Random Clue algorithm generates a random clue, 1 of 6 weapons, 1 of 6 murderers, and 1 of 10 locations.
Total there are 360 combinations. With the random approach there is no guarantee that the correct answer will
ever be reached. The best case scenario is it is guessed on the first try, worst case scenario the program
loops forever never randomly guessing the correct theory.
The time to get to the guess is not dependent on the ones selected
The main benefit to the random guess method is that it is very easy to implement and can work if time or resource
constraints are not critical. However when trying to solve a murder in under 20 turns these constraints are very
much of the highest importance.

The Sliding Pointer Clue algorithm starts at 1 for each category and tests the theory 1 1 1. If incorrect the
incorrect category is incremented and the theory is tested again until the correct answer is reached.
Every test clocked in at under 20 trials.
This does not change based on trial performed. (Trial 1 will always take 1 comparison as 1 1 1 is the answer)
This strategy cuts down on the number of comparisons as compared to the RandomClue and has a definite maximum number
of comparisons which is around 22.
