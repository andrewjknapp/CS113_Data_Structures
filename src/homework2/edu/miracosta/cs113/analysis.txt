Analysis of Theory Checkers

Random Clue
Trial  Total checks
1       351

The Random Clue algorithm generates a random clue, 1 of 6 weapons, 1 of 6 murderers, and 1 of 10 locations.
Total there are 360 combinations. With the random approach there is no guarantee that the correct answer will
ever be reached. The best case scenario is it is guessed on the first try, worst case scenario the program
loops forever never randomly guessing the correct theory.
The main benefit to the random guess method is that it is very easy to implement and can work if time or resource
constraints are not critical. However when trying to solve a murder in under 20 turns these constraints are very
much of the highest importance.
